# Project 1: Software Requirements Specification Document

This serves as a template for each projects' Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document. When filling this out, you will be required to create user stories, use cases, requirements, and a glossary of terms relevant to your project. Each group member must contribute to every section, so it is crucial that your group's GitHub repository shows a commit history that reflects the work of each group member. It is highly recommended that you create separate branches for each member, but since this is one single document, you will need to manually merge the branches together. It is also advisable to have multiple working versions of this document (named separately) so that one person can compile the final SRS document from the multiple working versions. Ultimately, how you go about managing this is up to you, but consistent formatting, clear commit messages, and a thorough commit history with contributions from each group member are required.

Fill the document out following the guidelines listed in each section. Maintain [proper Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

## Introduction

Our project is a web-based platform that allows users to create accounts, log in, and post messages to a global board. Users can view and interact with messages by up-voting or down-voting them. The system tracks the number of points earned by users for their messages and automatically takes down messages with a certain number of down-votes. The platform aims to provide a space for users to share their thoughts and engage with the community. The stakeholders of this system are the users who create accounts and participate in posting and voting on messages.

## Requirements

Each group member must supply at least three functional requirements for the project. Each requirement should be written in the following format:

- **REQ-1: Account Creation** 
  - **Description:** Users should be able to create an account by providing their necessary details.
  - **Type:** Functional
  - **Priority:** 1
  - **Rationale:** Account creation is essential for users to access the platform and post messages.
  - **Testing:** Verify that users can successfully create an account by providing the required information and receiving a confirmation message.
- **REQ-2: User Login** 
  - **Description:** Users should be able to log in to their accounts using their credentials.
  - **Type:** Functional
  - **Priority:** 1
  - **Rationale:** Login functionality is necessary to authenticate users and provide personalized access to their accounts.
  - **Testing:** Confirm that users can log in using their correct username and password and are granted access to their account.
- **REQ-3: Message Posting** 
  - **Description:** Users should be able to post messages to the global board.
  - **Type:** Functional
  - **Priority:** 2
  - **Rationale:** Message posting is the core functionality of the platform, allowing users to share their thoughts and engage with others.
  - **Testing:** Validate that users can successfully compose and post messages, which are then displayed on the global board.

## Constraints

- The system must be developed using Flask and Python.
- The user interface should be responsive and compatible with modern web browsers.

## Use Cases

In this section, you should list use cases for the project. Use cases are a thorough description of how the system will be used. Each group member must supply at least two use cases. Each use case should be written in the following format:

- **UC-1: User Registration** 
  - **Description:** A user creates a new account to join the platform.
  - **Actors:** User
  - **Preconditions:** None
  - **Postconditions:** The user successfully creates an account and gains access to the platform.
- **UC-2: User Login** 
  - **Description:** A registered user logs in to their account.
  - **Actors:** User
  - **Preconditions:** The user has a registered account.
  - **Postconditions:** The user is authenticated and gains access to their account.

## User Stories

In this section, you should list user stories for the project. User stories are a short description of how a user will be interacting with the system. Each group member must supply at least two user stories. Each user story should be written in the following format:

- **US-1: User Registration**
  - **Type of User:** New User
  - **Description:** As a new user, I want to create an account by providing my name, email address, and a secure password, so that I can join the platform and participate in discussions.
- **US-2: User Login**
  - **Type of User:** Registered User
  - **Description:** As a registered user, I want to log in to my account using my username and password, so that I can access my profile, post messages, and engage with the community.

## Glossary

In this section, you should list any terms that are used in the document that may not be immediately obvious to a naive reader. Each group member must supply at least one term. Each term should be written in the following format:

- **Term:** Flask
  - **Definition:** A micro web framework written in Python, used for building web applications.

Try to only list terms that a naive user would not understand.

## Submission Details

- On Canvas, submit the following:
  - The URL to your group's GitHub repository, with the latest version of your code pushed to the `main` branch.

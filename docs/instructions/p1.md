# Project 1: Software Requirements Specification Document

This serves as a template for each projects' Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document. When filling this out, you will be required to create user stories, use cases, requirements, and a glossary of terms relevant to your project. Each group member must contribute to every section, so it is crucial that your group's GitHub repository shows a commit history that reflects the work of each group member. It is highly recommended that you create separate branches for each member, but since this is one single document, you will need to manually merge the branches together. It is also advisable to have multiple working versions of this document (named separately) so that one person can compile the final SRS document from the multiple working versions. Ultimately, how you go about managing this is up to you, but consistent formatting, clear commit messages, and a thorough commit history with contributions from each group member are required.

Fill the document out following the guidelines listed in each section. Maintain [proper Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

## Introduction

Our project is a web-based platform that allows users to create accounts, log in, and post messages to a global board. Users can view and interact with messages by up-voting or down-voting them. The system tracks the number of points earned by users for their messages and automatically takes down messages with a certain number of down-votes. The platform aims to provide a space for users to share their thoughts and engage with the community. The stakeholders of this system are the users who create accounts and participate in posting and voting on messages.

  - **Rationale:** Account creation is essential for users to access the platform and post messages.
  - **Testing:** Verify that users can successfully create an account by providing the required information and receiving a confirmation message.

- **REQ-4: Profile Picture**
  - **Description:** Users should be able to add/customise a profile picture.
  - **Type:** Non-Functional
  - **Priority:** 4
  - **Rationale:** Users should be able to use profile pictures as a way to express themselves in addition to their messages.
  - **Testing:** Verify that users can change their profile pictures, which can then be seen by everyone else.
- **REQ-5: Message Deletion**
  - **Description:** Users should be able to delete a post they made.
  - **Type:** Functional
  - **Priority:** 3
  - **Rationale:** Users may make posts accidentally or unfinished and need a way to delete them.
  - **Testing:** Validate that users can successfully delete their messages from the global board.
- **REQ-6: Report Ability**
  - **Description:** Users should be able to report posts or other users.
  - **Type:** Functional
  - **Priority:** 3
  - **Rationale:** Users may make obscene posts, have obscene profile pictures, or harass others.
  - **Testing:** Verify that the report button appears and that it sends a message to system administrators when used.
- **REQ-7: User Blocking**
  - **Description:** Users should have the ability to block or mute other users to prevent further interactions.
  - **Type:** Functional
  - **Priority:** 2
  - **Rationale:** Users may block other user to avoid unwantedinteractions.
